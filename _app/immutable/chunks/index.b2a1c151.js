import{C as e}from"./types.1ebf2f37.js";const t=`My first experience as a developer was at the company **Radar Saúde**, working as a **full stack developer**, with the goal of acquiring knowledge in different areas. Initially, I was tested in the update of a front-end library, which brought a major change to the structure of the product's front-end.

Shortly after the library update, I was assigned tasks that tested my knowledge in **back-end**, such as improving the performance of queries in the platform's main modules. I also participated, together with other developers, in the **architecture of a solution** for exporting large volumes of data.

Finally, shortly before being hired as a full-time developer, I developed, together with another developer, a **geolocation functionality** with map interaction. In this functionality, the user could create administrative regions on the map and assign these areas to different sectors, using a simple but very effective interface.

This is just a summary of the experiences acquired during this period, as it is not possible to describe everything.`,a={description:t,shortDescription:"My first experience with professional software development involved working as a full stack developer, creating and updating end-to-end features, always learning and evolving throughout the process.",name:"Trainee at Radar Saúde",title:"Trainee"},r={[e.Freelance]:"Freelance",[e.FullTime]:"Tempo Integral",[e.Internship]:"Estágio",[e.PartTime]:"Meio Período",[e.SelfEmployed]:"Autônomo",[e.Contract]:"Contrato"},n={["trainee-radar"]:a,contractType:r};export{n as default};
