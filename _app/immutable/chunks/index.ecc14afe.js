const e=`[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It is an essential part of the web technology stack, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables dynamic behavior on websites.

## Key Features of JavaScript:

1. **Interpreted Language**: JavaScript is typically executed directly by the web browser, without requiring prior compilation, making it an interpreted language.

2. **Client-Side Execution**: JavaScript code runs on the user's device (client-side), which allows for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces. It can also be used server-side with environments like Node.js.

3. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime rather than in advance, which offers flexibility but can lead to type-related bugs.

4. **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: Unlike many other object-oriented languages that use class-based inheritance, JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.

5. **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to user actions (like clicks, keypresses, etc.), which is critical for creating interactive web applications.

6. **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, primarily through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, which helps in handling operations like API calls, file reading, or timers without blocking the main execution thread.
`,a=`[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is an open-source programming language that extends JavaScript by adding optional static typing and other advanced features. It is widely used for web development, especially in large-scale projects, because it improves code predictability and makes it easier to maintain.

## Main Features of TypeScript:

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript allows you to define types for variables, functions, and objects. This helps catch errors at compile time, before the code is executed, providing greater security and reliability.

2. **JavaScript Support**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This makes it easier to adopt TypeScript in existing projects.

3. **JavaScript Compilation**: TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, allowing it to run in any environment that supports JavaScript, such as browsers or Node.js.

4. **Class-Based Inheritance**: TypeScript supports class-based inheritance, allowing developers to use a more traditional object-oriented programming style, similar to that found in languages ​​like Java or C#.

5. **Integration with Tools and IDEs**: TypeScript offers excellent integration with development tools and IDEs, providing features such as code completion, code navigation, and refactoring, which increase developer productivity.

6. **Asynchronous Programming**: Like JavaScript, TypeScript supports asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await, allowing the development of responsive and efficient applications.

7. **Wide Adoption and Active Community**: TypeScript has been adopted by large companies and open-source projects, which has resulted in an active community and a large ecosystem of compatible libraries and tools.`,t=`React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UI). React makes it easy to develop modern web applications by enabling the creation of reusable components and efficient management of application state.

## Key Features of React:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React is based on components, which are reusable building blocks for user interfaces. Each component can have its own state and logic, allowing the creation of complex UIs in a modular and maintainable way.

2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a Virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the real [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) tree. When a component’s state changes, the Virtual [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) is updated first, and then React compares that version with the real [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) and applies only the necessary changes, improving the application’s performance.

3. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React promotes a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to children. This makes the application more predictable and makes it easier to track bugs and debug.

4. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create React components by providing a more intuitive and readable syntax for building user interfaces.

5. **Rich Ecosystem**: React has a vast and ever-growing ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools that complement its functionality, such as React Router for route management and Redux for global state management.

6. **Active Community and Industry Support**: React is maintained by a large community of developers and is widely used in companies of all sizes. The vast amount of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries available make React a popular choice for developing modern web applications.`,n=`Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla Research, Rust was designed to overcome the limitations of languages ​​like C and C++ by offering memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.

## Key Features of Rust:

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents common memory errors, such as null pointers and memory leaks, through its ownership system. This system ensures that each piece of memory has a single owner, preventing race conditions and other concurrency-related problems.

2. **High Performance**: Rust is designed to be a low-level language, offering direct control over memory allocation and manipulation. This allows Rust programs to achieve performance comparable to those written in C or C++, making it suitable for developing systems and applications that require high efficiency.

3. **Fearless Concurrency**: Rust makes it easy to write safe concurrent code, avoiding deadlocks and other common pitfalls in parallel programming. Rust’s type system ensures that concurrent memory accesses are safe at compile time.

4. **Rich and Expressive Type System**: Rust has an advanced type system, including enumerations, pattern matching, generics, and traits, allowing you to create expressive and reusable code. This improves readability and makes your code easier to maintain.

5. **No Garbage Collector**: Unlike many other modern languages, Rust does not have a garbage collector. This means that the developer has full control over when and how memory is freed, resulting in more efficient use of resources.

6. **Robust Development Tools**: Rust comes with a suite of powerful tools, including Cargo, its build system and package manager, and Rustfmt, which automatically formats code to adhere to style conventions.

7. **Active and Growing Community**: Rust has a vibrant and growing community, with a wide range of libraries and tools available in the Crates.io package repository. The language is used in a variety of industries, from embedded systems development to building large web services.

8. **Integration with C and C++**: Rust offers interoperability with C and C++, allowing you to integrate legacy code or use libraries written in those languages. This makes it easy to gradually adopt Rust into existing projects.
