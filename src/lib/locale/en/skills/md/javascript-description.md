[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It is an essential part of the web technology stack, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables dynamic behavior on websites.

## Key Features of JavaScript:

1. **Interpreted Language**: JavaScript is typically executed directly by the web browser, without requiring prior compilation, making it an interpreted language.

2. **Client-Side Execution**: JavaScript code runs on the user's device (client-side), which allows for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces. It can also be used server-side with environments like Node.js.

3. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime rather than in advance, which offers flexibility but can lead to type-related bugs.

4. **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: Unlike many other object-oriented languages that use class-based inheritance, JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.

5. **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to user actions (like clicks, keypresses, etc.), which is critical for creating interactive web applications.

6. **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, primarily through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, which helps in handling operations like API calls, file reading, or timers without blocking the main execution thread.
