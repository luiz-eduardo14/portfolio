My first experience as a developer was at the company **Radar Sa√∫de**, working as a **full stack developer**, with the goal of acquiring knowledge in different areas. Initially, I was tested in the update of a front-end library, which brought a major change to the structure of the product's front-end.

Shortly after the library update, I was assigned tasks that tested my knowledge in **back-end**, such as improving the performance of queries in the platform's main modules. I also participated, together with other developers, in the **architecture of a solution** for exporting large volumes of data.

Finally, shortly before being hired as a full-time developer, I developed, together with another developer, a **geolocation functionality** with map interaction. In this functionality, the user could create administrative regions on the map and assign these areas to different sectors, using a simple but very effective interface.

This is just a summary of the experiences acquired during this period, as it is not possible to describe everything.
